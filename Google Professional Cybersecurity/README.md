# Google Professional Cybersecurity Notes

These are my full, in-depth notes from the **Google Professional Certificate in Cybersecurity** course.

Unlike my [LinkedIn post](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bradwatson3/), which summarizes the experience at a high level, this folder contains **all notes I created during the course**, including key concepts, terminology, and hands-on skills.
