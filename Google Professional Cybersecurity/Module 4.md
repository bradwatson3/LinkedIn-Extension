#### Important CyberSecurity Tools

- As an entry-level security analyst, you'll have a lot of tools in your toolkit that you can use to mitigate potential risks.
    - A log is a record of events that occur within an organization's systems. Examples of security-related logs include records of employees signing into their computers or accessing web-based services.
    - The first tools we'll discuss are security information and event management tools, or SIEM tools. A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization.
    - Splunk is a data analysis platform, and Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions. Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool used to retain, analyze, and search an organization's log data.
    - Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that stores security data for search and analysis. Cloud-native means that Chronicle allows for fast delivery of new features.
    - As a security analyst, you may find yourself using SIEM tools to analyze filtered events and patterns, perform incident analysis, or proactively search for threats. Depending on your organization's SIEM setup and risk focus, the tools and how they function may differ, but ultimately, they are all used to mitigate risk.
    - A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to an incident. Playbooks, which vary from one organization to the next, guide analysts in how to handle a security incident before, during, and after it has occurred.
    - A packet sniffer is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic within a network.
    - As an entry-level analyst, you don't have to be an expert in these tools.
    - An entry-level analyst’s toolkit:
      - Security information and event management (SIEM) tools
        - A SIEM tool is an application that collects and analyzes log data to monitor critical activities in an organization. A log is a record of events that occur within an organization’s systems.
      - Network protocol analyzers (packet sniffers).
        - A network protocol analyzer, also known as a packet sniffer, is a tool designed to capture and analyze data traffic in a network.
      - Playbooks
        - A playbook is a manual that provides details about any operational action, such as how to respond to a security incident. Organizations usually have multiple playbooks documenting processes and procedures for their teams to follow.

#### Core CyberSec Knowledge and Skills

- Analysts also use programming languages and operating systems to accomplish essential tasks.
    - Organizations can use programming to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Programming allows analysts to complete repetitive tasks and processes with a high degree of accuracy and efficiency.
    - Linux is an open-source, or publicly available, operating system.
    - SQL stands for Structured Query Language. SQL is a programming language used to create, interact with, and request information from a database.
    - Security professionals can use Python to perform tasks that are repetitive and time-consuming and that require a high level of detail and accuracy.
    - Tools and their purposes:
      - Programming
        - Programming is a process that can be used to create a specific set of instructions for a computer to execute tasks. Security analysts use programming languages, such as Python, to execute automation.
        - Automation is the use of technology to reduce human and manual effort in performing common and repetitive tasks. Automation also helps reduce the risk of human error.
      - Operating systems
        - An operating system is the interface between computer hardware and the user. Linux, macOS, and Windows are operating systems. They each offer different functionality and user experiences.
      - Web vulnerability
        - A web vulnerability is a unique flaw in a web application that a threat actor could exploit by using malicious code or behavior, to allow unauthorized access, data theft, and malware deployment.
      - Antivirus software
        - Antivirus software is a software program used to prevent, detect, and eliminate malware and viruses.
      - Intrusion detection system
        - An intrusion detection system (IDS) is an application that monitors system activity and alerts on possible intrusions.
      - Encryption
        - Encryption makes data unreadable and difficult to decode for an unauthorized user; its main goal is to ensure confidentiality of private data.
        - Encryption is the process of converting data from a readable format to a cryptographically encoded format.
        - Cryptographic encoding means converting plaintext into secure ciphertext.
        - Plaintext is unencrypted information and secure ciphertext is the result of encryption.
      - Penetration testing
        - Penetration testing, also called pen testing, is the act of participating in a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in systems, networks, websites, applications, and processes.
    - Create a cybersecurity portfolio:
      - What is a portfolio, and why is it necessary?
        - Cybersecurity professionals use portfolios to demonstrate their security education, skills, and knowledge. Professionals typically use portfolios when they apply for jobs to show potential employers that they are passionate about their work and can do the job they are applying for.
      - Options for creating your portfolio
        - There are many ways to present a portfolio, including self-hosted and online options such as:
          - Documents folder

Document folders allow you to have direct access to your documentation. For example, you may want to create a main folder titled something like “Professional documents.” Then, within your main folder, you could create subfolders with titles such as:
- Resume
- Education
- Portfolio documents
- Cybersecurity tools
- Programming

- - - - - Google Drive or Dropbox
Google Drive and Dropbox offer similar features that allow you to store your professional documentation on a cloud platform. Both options also have file-sharing features, so you can easily share your portfolio documents with potential employers.

- - - - - Google Sites
Google Sites and similar website hosting options have a variety of easy-to-use features to help you present your portfolio items, including customizable layouts, responsive webpages, embedded content capabilities, and web publishing.

- - - - - Git repository
A Git repository is a folder within a project. In this instance, the project is your portfolio, and you can use your repository to store the documents, labs, and screenshots you complete during each course of the certificate program. There are several Git repository sites you can use, including:

-  Portfolio projects
	- These opportunities include:
		- Drafting a professional statement
		- Conducting a security audit
		- Analyzing network structure and security
		- Using Linux commands to manage file permissions
		- Applying filters to SQL queries
		- Identifying vulnerabilities for a small business
		- Documenting incidents with an incident handler’s journal
		- Importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenario
		- Creating or revising a resume
