### Module 3

#### Frameworks and Controls
- As an analyst, you'll start by identifying your organization's critical assets and risks. Then you'll implement the necessary frameworks and controls.
    - Security frameworks are guidelines used for building plans to help mitigate risks and threats to data and privacy. Security frameworks provide a structured approach to implementing a security lifecycle. The security lifecycle is a constantly evolving set of policies and standards that define how an organization manages risks, follows established guidelines, and meets regulatory compliance, or laws.
    - The purpose of security frameworks include protecting personally identifiable information, known as PII, securing financial information, identifying security weaknesses, managing organizational risks, and aligning security with business goals.
    - Frameworks have four core components and understanding them will allow you to better manage potential risks. The first core component is identifying and documenting security goals.The second core component is setting guidelines to achieve security goals. The third core component of security frameworks is implementing strong security processes. The last core component of security frameworks is monitoring and communicating results.
    - Frameworks allow analysts to work alongside other members of the security team to document, implement, and use the policies and procedures that have been created.
    - Security controls are safeguards designed to reduce specific security risks. Security frameworks and controls are vital to managing security for all types of organizations and ensuring that everyone is doing their part to maintain a low level of risk.
    - The CIA triad is a foundational model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies. CIA stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
    - Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data. Integrity means the data is correct, authentic, and reliable. Availability means data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it.
    - How controls, frameworks, and compliance are related:
      - The confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) triad is a model that helps inform how organizations consider risk when setting up systems and security policies.
    - Specific controls, frameworks, and compliance
      - The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC): FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid.
      - The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP): FedRAMP is a U.S. federal government program that standardizes security assessment, authorization, monitoring, and handling of cloud services and product offerings.
      - Center for Internet Security (CIS): CIS is a nonprofit with multiple areas of emphasis. It provides a set of controls that can be used to safeguard systems and networks against attacks.
      - General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory.
      - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS): PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment.
      - The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA): HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information.
      - International Organization for Standardization (ISO): ISO was created to establish international standards related to technology, manufacturing, and management across borders.
      - System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2): The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard.
      - United States Presidential Executive Order 14028: On May 12, 2021, President Joe Biden released an executive order related to improving the nation’s cybersecurity to remediate the increase in threat actor activity.

#### Ethics in CyberSec
- As a security professional, you'll encounter proprietary or private information, such as PII. It's your ethical duty to keep that information confidential and safe.
    - The second ethical principle to consider is privacy protections. Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
    - As a security analyst, your role is to follow the policies and procedures of your company
    - A third important ethical principle we must discuss is the law. Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.
    - Ethical concerns and laws related to counterattacks:
      - United States standpoint on counterattacks: In the U.S., deploying a counterattack on a threat actor is illegal because of laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015, among others.
      - International standpoint on counterattacks
      - The International Court of Justice (ICJ), which updates its guidance regularly, states that a person or group can counterattack if:
        - The counterattack will only affect the party that attacked first.
        - The counterattack is a direct communication asking the initial attacker to stop.
        - The counterattack does not escalate the situation.
        - The counterattack effects can be reversed.
    - Ethical principles and methodologies:
      - Confidentiality means that only authorized users can access specific assets or data.
      - Privacy protection means safeguarding personal information from unauthorized use.
      - Laws are rules that are recognized by a community and enforced by a governing entity.
